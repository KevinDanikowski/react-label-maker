### Set Up

The wizard accepts any wizard object context and can accept any number of steps. It's reusable as a step through wizard to generate some final object data.

Steps can involve form validation, or any variety of additional options. 

The completion step can also provide anything the person desires, in this case it's a printing label. But it could be some 3d display of points or what ever else that would use the widget data (some modifications would be necessary in this situation, but it's not far off).

### theming

It uses semantic ui, a largely popular basic UI framework for forms and inputs and allows easy form validations and other popular widgets like a progress bar.

### Login

For the sake of time no login system was added, 

### testing

`npm run test`
